# CryptoFlipper BETA
Currently: BETA 1.0.0

Description:
Hypixel Skyblock auction flipping mod. It basically just tells you underpriced items, so you can put them up for a higher price to make $$$. Do /ME to set the config, and /ME ON to start the mod. You have to start the mod everytime you join Hypixel.

Features:
- Tells you in chat when it finds a flip
- Can detect market manipulation
- Looks at enchants, hot potato books, stars, and gemstones for good flips
- BIN Flipper Mode
- AH Flipper Mode
- As well as AH to BIN
- Download to be very cool and get women
- Can set the size of margins you want
- Minimum Price
- Maximum Price
- Amount of sales per day
- Automatically Updates
- BZ Flipper?? (WIP)

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK FEATURES:
- Automatically buys items and sells them for lowest BIN
- Anti-Escrow
- Auto buy booster cookie (for /ah and no AFK kicks)
- The things listed in this category are not detected, but probably don't follow Hypixel's rules. DO NOT USE THE FEATURES IN "USE AT YOUR OWN RISK FEATURES:" IF YOU DON'T WANT TO RISK A BAN. I am not responsible if you get banned.

NOTE: 
- The more money you have the more money you will make. (Very common sense, but don't want people getting angry.) 
- For some reason BZ notifier breaks with this mod. Remove BZ notifier mod and it will fix itself.

Report bugs pls.

DM crypted#0271 on Discord if you have problems (Server Coming Soon).
